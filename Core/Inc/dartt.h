	TODO: put the information in this comment into the README
	
	WE ARE ALWAYS LITTLE ENDIAN.
	This library is meant to be C-standard compliant, but to be used in a way which is technically NOT standard compliant (type punning).
	Specifically, if you are targeting little-endian 32bit architectures, such as an ARM STM32, you *can* set this up so that the generic memory
	regions you are reading and writing to are typedef structs (with the packed attribute if desired). This means you don't need any additional
	parsing layer - once you load the memory from an incoming write request frame, it is immediately accessible via the struct.

	The rationale is that:
		1. if you control the target architecture and it never changes, this optimization will always work
		2. DX improves drastically if you don't have to implement explicit parsing. Laying out your memory as a struct means you never have to write parsers for general settings messages - 
			only for very tight and specific message types!
*/

/*
	TODO:
		unit test set_rw and set_index. Make sure they are order independent as desired
		unit test the forward and reverse functions (msg to buf and buf to msg)
		refactor the parse function to use the above
		refactor the unit tests to use only the new functions; remove create_msic_write, create_misc_read, and parse_misc_command. Keep parse_general and index_of_field. Fix warnings in index_of_field - ensure casting is explicit
